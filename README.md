# How to run

Within each repository you are in, you can start up the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/`. folder contains the code that defines each page according to NextJS's file-based routing system. A significant folders within some projects are `page/api`, which define API routes to backend, which are later used to render information from a database onto the website

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on `http://localhost:3000/api/ { whatever api path is defined }`.
